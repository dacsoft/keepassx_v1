keepassx_v1
===========

AFAIK...

* the new KeePassX on GitHub is https://github.com/keepassx/keepassx
* was migrated from https://gitorious.org/+keepassx-developers
* which has only a small number of branches, all of them 2.X

So it seems V1 was dropped and forked into a new release.

Fine, but my UUID export patch was never submitted, and I want it to live here so I don't lose it.

SO here is the migrated V1 with my patch on export_UUID branch
